## Exploit toolkit CVE-2017-0199
Exploit toolkit CVE-2017-0199 is a handy python script which provides pentesters and security researchers a quick and effective way to test Microsoft Office RCE. 
It could generate a malicious RTF/PPSX file and deliver metasploit / meterpreter / other payload to victim without any complex configuration. 

This script has been modified to work with python 3. The previous versions didn't work.
I had to go fix this scrip manually.

Enjoy!!
